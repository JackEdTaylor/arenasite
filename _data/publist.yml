- title: "Traces of meaning itself: Encoding distributional word vectors in brain activity"
  image: tracesofmeaning.png
  description: We show evidence that distributional word vector models can describe brain activity, measured by EEG, elicited words without context. These results suggest that empiricist, prediction-based vectorial representations of meaning are a viable candidate for the representational architecture of human semantic knowledge.
