  pi: "Jochen Triesch"
  info: "This project asks how human infants can learn to form abstract object representations so much more autonomously than current AI systems. It proposes a new approach for learning object representations, integrating classic ideas from Neuroscience (exploiting temporal structure, intrinsic motivation) and Machine Learning (self-supervised contrastive learning, artificial curiosity). Through this, it hopes to further our understanding of human learning and contribute to developing autonomously learning AI models."
