  info: Christian Fiebach is Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at Goethe University Frankfurt. He is also a PI at Goethe Universityâ€™s Brain Imaging Center. His research is aimed at understanding the brain mechanisms underlying higher cognitive abilities such as language comprehension and visual word recognition, cognitive flexibility, as well as neurobiological correlates of individual differences in general cognitive ability (intelligence). To this end, he uses non-invasive neuroimaging methods, in particular functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiology.

  info: Gemma Roig is Professor of Data Analytics and Modeling at the Computer Science Department of Goethe University Frankfurt., Her research focuses on understanding the computational principles underlying visual intelligence of humans and artificial systems, with the aim of developing a general artificial intelligence framework. To this end, she develops computational models using deep learning and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms, and uses those to explain behavioural and brain data, including fMRI and EEG.

  info: Matthias Kaschube is Professor for Computational Neuroscience and Computational Vision in the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at Goethe University, and Senior Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies. His research focuses on the interplay of the different factors (llike genetic vs. sensory inout) leading to the development of cortical circuits, on relevant features of brain circuits that support cognitive processes, as well as the robustness of cortical circuits against cellular, subcellular and molecular changes.
