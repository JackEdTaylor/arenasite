  text: "A European perspective on structural barriers to women`s career progression in neuroscience
Date and Time: 07th May 2024, 12:00 - 14:00
Location: Seminar room 5G 170,PEG, Westend Campus, Goethe University
Despite an unprecedented number of women entering neuroscience, and decades-long recruitment and retention efforts, women continue to be disproportionately underrepresented in European academic tenure-track faculty and leadership positions. This Perspective focuses on two major career points where women exhibit diminished representation: the transition from postdoctoral fellow to junior professor and the promotion to more senior (tenured) faculty positions. We discuss below recently implemented country-specific and Europe-wide initiatives supporting equal career progression and propose further concrete steps to be taken to break down the structural barriers that prevent women’s progression up the academic career ladder as European neuroscientists.
Training for female scientists
The Career Support – Training for Female Scientists* program offered by the Office for Equal Opportunities at Goethe University, offers variety of courses tailored to the specific needs of postdocs (R2 and R3). These training courses are measures designed to counteract the structural disadvantages faced by women* in the scientific field.
